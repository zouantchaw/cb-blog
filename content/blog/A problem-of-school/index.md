**School isn’t an education**.

It is a part of an education. Many lose perspective of that detail because of the important place we give to this institution in North America. But has that place become too big?

Many people feel uncomfortable with school’s practices and structures. A part of those people even drop out. It seems obvious that this system is inadequate.

**The problem is simple: we are not autonomous in our creativity.**

The structure in which we evolve in school makes us dependent on a given and constant flow of information in which we draw to find a subject to elaborate on. « Creativity » is given to you therefore you do not have to be creative. And this is how you end up with college graduates who don’t know what they feel passionate about.

What I learned at school:

Read and listen until you know enough to express yourself.

What I didn’t learn at school:

At what point do you know if you read or listened enough.

We are taught, through that process, that our words don’t have credibility. Therefore, sharing ideas is not for us yet. A diploma is what we are missing to make a valid point. Not entirely true.
