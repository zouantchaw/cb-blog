**What is doubt?**

My homemade definition is that it is the feeling of being uncertain or even afraid about the outcome of something. You doubt because you’re scared. In the context of creating something, doubt is a form of self-preservation because what you’re really afraid of is bad feedback. But also, it is a form of vicious procrastination.

Don’t undervalue yourself.

**It is ridiculous to not do something because you doubt you can be successful.**

**ONE**: Because you assume that to achieve something you have to have some kind of success. False. Failure is an achievement too. This is what you learn from.

**TWO**: Because you assume that you are a better judge for your work than everyone else. You consider your own opinion on you project as the most important opinion. False again. Other people might think it’s shitty too but at least you will have feedbacks on how to improve it (which brings you back to the first point). Or, other people might be inspired by it. Which you would never allow if you don’t share your ideas.

Either way. The feeling of doubt is irrelevant.
